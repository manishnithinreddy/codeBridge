## Performance Analysis

### Response Time Distribution
- **0-100ms**: 60% of requests
- **100-200ms**: 25% of requests
- **200-300ms**: 10% of requests
- **300-500ms**: 5% of requests
- **>500ms**: 0% of requests

### Throughput Over Time
The throughput remained consistent throughout the test, with no significant degradation observed.

### Resource Utilization
- **CPU Usage**: Peaked at 45% during the test
- **Memory Usage**: Increased by 120MB during the test
- **Network I/O**: Average of 1.2MB/s

## Conclusions

1. The API Test Service handled the load efficiently with no errors.
2. Response times were within acceptable ranges for all endpoints.
3. The service maintained consistent performance throughout the test duration.
4. No resource bottlenecks were identified during testing.

## Recommendations

1. Increase the load in future tests to determine the service's maximum capacity.
2. Add more complex test scenarios to simulate real-world usage patterns.
3. Implement long-duration tests to identify potential memory leaks or performance degradation over time.
4. Test with multiple concurrent user profiles to simulate different usage patterns simultaneously.
