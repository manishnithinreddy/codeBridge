# Phase 8: Scalability and High Availability

This document provides an overview of the Scalability and High Availability features implemented in Phase 8 of the CodeBridge project.

## Overview

The implementation focuses on three main areas:

1. **Horizontal Scaling**: Enabling the application to scale out by adding more instances
2. **Data Resilience**: Ensuring data is protected against failures and can be recovered
3. **High Availability**: Minimizing downtime and ensuring continuous operation

## Implementation Details

### Horizontal Scaling

- **Load Balancing**: Multiple strategies including Round Robin, Least Connections, Weighted, and IP Hash
- **Auto-Scaling**: Metric-based scaling decisions with configurable thresholds and cooldown periods
- **Session Management**: Distributed session support with Redis, Hazelcast, and JDBC backends

### Data Resilience

- **Replication**: Data replication with configurable consistency levels (ONE, QUORUM, ALL)
- **Backup and Recovery**: Scheduled backups with verification and point-in-time recovery
- **Data Partitioning**: Horizontal data sharding with support for hash, range, and list partitioning strategies

### High Availability

- **Idempotency Support**: Ensures operations are only executed once, even if requests are retried
- **Circuit Breakers**: Prevents cascading failures by failing fast when dependencies are unavailable
- **Rate Limiting**: Protects services from being overwhelmed by too many requests

## Key Components

1. **Session Management**:
   - Configurable session store (Redis, Hazelcast, JDBC)
   - Secure cookie configuration
   - Session replication and failover

2. **Load Balancing**:
   - Multiple load balancing strategies
   - Health checking and circuit breaking
   - Sticky sessions support

3. **Auto-Scaling**:
   - Metric-based scaling decisions
   - Configurable thresholds and cooldown periods
   - Graceful scaling operations

4. **Data Resilience**:
   - Replication with configurable consistency levels
   - Scheduled backups with verification
   - Data partitioning with multiple strategies

5. **Idempotency**:
   - Request deduplication
   - Multiple storage options
   - Configurable expiration

## Configuration

The implementation is highly configurable through the `application.yml` file and environment variables:

```yaml
codebridge:
  scalability:
    # Session configuration
    session:
      store-type: redis  # Options: redis, hazelcast, jdbc
    
    # Load balancing configuration
    load-balancing:
      strategy: round-robin  # Options: round-robin, least-connections, weighted, ip-hash
      sticky-sessions: true
    
    # Auto-scaling configuration
    auto-scaling:
      enabled: true
      cpu-threshold: 70
      memory-threshold: 80
    
    # Data resilience configuration
    data-resilience:
      replication:
        enabled: true
        consistency-level: QUORUM  # Options: ONE, QUORUM, ALL
      backup:
        enabled: true
        schedule: "0 0 2 * * ?"  # Cron expression
      partitioning:
        enabled: true
        strategy: hash  # Options: hash, range, list
    
    # Idempotency configuration
    idempotency:
      enabled: true
      storage-type: redis  # Options: redis, hazelcast, jdbc
```

## Benefits

1. **Improved Scalability**: The application can handle increased load by adding more instances
2. **Enhanced Reliability**: Data is protected against failures and can be recovered
3. **Increased Availability**: Downtime is minimized and continuous operation is ensured
4. **Better Performance**: Load is distributed across multiple instances
5. **Improved User Experience**: Sessions are maintained even if instances fail

## Future Enhancements

1. **Global Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic across multiple regions
2. **Multi-Region Replication**: Replicate data across multiple regions
3. **Disaster Recovery**: Implement cross-region failover
4. **Chaos Testing**: Test resilience by deliberately introducing failures
5. **Automated Scaling**: Implement predictive auto-scaling based on historical patterns
