# CodeBridge Microservices Consolidation Migration Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan for migrating from the current microservices architecture to the consolidated architecture. The consolidation involves merging several smaller services into more cohesive, larger services while maintaining all functionality.

## Services to be Consolidated

1. **Auth Gateway + Security Service → Identity Service**
2. **User Management Service + Teams Service → Organization Service**
3. **Webhook Service + Audit Service → Events Service**

## Migration Strategy

The migration will follow a phased approach to minimize disruption and ensure a smooth transition.

### Phase 1: Preparation (Week 1-2)

1. **Create New Service Structures**
   - Set up the new consolidated services with their basic structure
   - Create the necessary package structure
   - Set up build files and configurations
   - Implement the main application classes

2. **Database Schema Planning**
   - Design the consolidated database schemas
   - Create migration scripts for data transfer
   - Test schema migrations in a development environment

3. **API Contract Definition**
   - Define the API contracts for the new services
   - Ensure backward compatibility with existing clients
   - Document the new API endpoints

### Phase 2: Code Migration (Week 3-4)

1. **Identity Service Implementation**
   - Migrate authentication and authorization code from Auth Gateway
   - Migrate session management code from Security Service
   - Implement new consolidated controllers, services, and repositories
   - Ensure all functionality is preserved

2. **Organization Service Implementation**
   - Migrate user profile management code from User Management Service
   - Migrate team management code from Teams Service
   - Implement new consolidated controllers, services, and repositories
   - Ensure all functionality is preserved

3. **Events Service Implementation**
   - Migrate webhook handling code from Webhook Service
   - Migrate audit logging code from Audit Service
   - Implement new consolidated controllers, services, and repositories
   - Ensure all functionality is preserved

### Phase 3: Testing (Week 5-6)

1. **Unit Testing**
   - Implement unit tests for all new services
   - Ensure test coverage is maintained or improved

2. **Integration Testing**
   - Test the interaction between the new services
   - Test the interaction with the remaining services
   - Verify that all functionality works as expected

3. **Performance Testing**
   - Benchmark the performance of the new services
   - Compare with the performance of the old services
   - Optimize as necessary

4. **Security Testing**
   - Verify that all security measures are in place
   - Test authentication and authorization
   - Ensure data protection and privacy

### Phase 4: Deployment (Week 7-8)

1. **Deployment Preparation**
   - Update deployment scripts and configurations
   - Set up monitoring and alerting for the new services
   - Prepare rollback plans

2. **Parallel Running**
   - Deploy the new services alongside the old services
   - Gradually route traffic to the new services
   - Monitor for any issues

3. **Cutover**
   - Once confident, route all traffic to the new services
   - Keep the old services running for a short period as a backup
   - Monitor closely for any issues

4. **Decommissioning**
   - After a successful cutover, decommission the old services
   - Archive the code and data for reference
   - Update documentation

## Data Migration

### Identity Service

1. **User Data**
   - Migrate user data from Auth Gateway
   - Ensure password hashes are correctly transferred
   - Verify user roles and permissions

2. **Session Data**
   - Migrate active sessions from Security Service
   - Ensure session tokens remain valid
   - Update session management logic

### Organization Service

1. **User Profile Data**
   - Migrate user profiles from User Management Service
   - Ensure all profile fields are correctly transferred
   - Verify user preferences and settings

2. **Team Data**
   - Migrate team data from Teams Service
   - Ensure team hierarchies are preserved
   - Verify team memberships and roles

### Events Service

1. **Webhook Data**
   - Migrate webhook configurations from Webhook Service
   - Ensure webhook events are correctly transferred
   - Verify webhook processing logic

2. **Audit Data**
   - Migrate audit logs from Audit Service
   - Ensure all audit fields are correctly transferred
   - Verify audit querying functionality

## Risks and Mitigations

### Data Loss Risk

**Risk**: Data could be lost during migration.
**Mitigation**: 
- Create backups before migration
- Implement validation checks after migration
- Keep the old services running until confident in the new services

### Service Disruption Risk

**Risk**: Services could be disrupted during migration.
**Mitigation**:
- Use a blue-green deployment strategy
- Perform migrations during low-traffic periods
- Have a rollback plan ready

### Performance Degradation Risk

**Risk**: The consolidated services could have worse performance.
**Mitigation**:
- Conduct thorough performance testing
- Optimize database queries and service interactions
- Scale resources as needed

### Integration Failure Risk

**Risk**: The new services might not integrate correctly with other services.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement comprehensive integration tests
- Maintain API compatibility
- Monitor service interactions closely

## Success Criteria

The migration will be considered successful when:

1. All functionality from the old services is available in the new services
2. Performance is equal to or better than the old services
3. No data loss or corruption has occurred
4. All clients can interact with the new services without issues
5. The system is stable and reliable

## Rollback Plan

If critical issues are encountered during the migration, the following rollback plan will be executed:

1. Revert traffic routing to the old services
2. Restore any affected data from backups
3. Analyze the issues and update the migration plan
4. Reschedule the migration after addressing the issues

## Post-Migration Activities

1. **Monitoring**
   - Monitor the new services closely for any issues
   - Track performance metrics and compare with baselines
   - Address any issues promptly

2. **Documentation**
   - Update all documentation to reflect the new architecture
   - Provide migration guides for client applications
   - Document lessons learned from the migration

3. **Optimization**
   - Identify opportunities for further optimization
   - Implement improvements based on real-world usage
   - Continue to refine the architecture
