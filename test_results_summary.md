# JMeter Performance Test Results Summary

## Test Execution Summary

The JMeter performance test was executed successfully with the following parameters:
- **Test Duration**: 60 seconds
- **Thread Groups**:
  - Health Check Thread Group: 10 concurrent users
  - DB Session Lifecycle Thread Group: 50 concurrent users
  - File Transfer Thread Group: 20 concurrent users
- **Total Requests**: 1,278
- **Average Throughput**: 21.3 requests/second

## Performance Metrics

From the test execution logs:

```
summary = 1278 in 00:01:00 = 21.3/s Avg: 0 Min: 0 Max: 25 Err: 1278 (100.00%)
```

### Key Observations:

1. **Connection Errors**: All requests (100%) resulted in errors, specifically "Connection refused" errors. This indicates that the test was unable to connect to the target service at localhost:8080.

2. **Response Times**:
   - **Average**: 0ms
   - **Minimum**: 0ms
   - **Maximum**: 25ms
   
   These values are very low because the requests failed at the connection stage without actually reaching the service.

3. **Throughput**: Despite the connection errors, the test maintained a throughput of approximately 21.3 requests per second.

## Error Analysis

The primary error observed was:
```
Non HTTP response code: org.apache.http.conn.HttpHostConnectException
Non HTTP response message: Connect to localhost:8080 [localhost/127.0.0.1] failed: Connection refused
```

This error indicates that:
1. The test was configured to connect to `localhost:8080`
2. No service was listening on that port
3. All connection attempts were refused

## Recommendations

To obtain meaningful performance test results:

1. **Ensure Service Availability**:
   - Verify that the CodeBridge Session Service is running on the target host and port
   - Check if the service is accessible from the test environment

2. **Update Test Configuration**:
   - Modify the host/port settings in the test plan to point to the actual service location
   - If testing against a remote service, ensure network connectivity and firewall rules allow the connection

3. **Authentication Setup**:
   - Ensure valid authentication tokens are configured if the service requires authentication

4. **Rerun the Test**:
   - After addressing the connection issues, rerun the test to collect actual performance metrics

## Next Steps

1. Start the CodeBridge Session Service on localhost:8080 or update the test configuration to point to the correct service location
2. Rerun the test with the corrected configuration
3. Generate an HTML report from the successful test results for detailed analysis
4. Analyze the report to identify performance bottlenecks and optimization opportunities
